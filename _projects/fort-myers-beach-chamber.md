Fort Myers Beach Chamber is a chamber of commerce located in Fort Myers Beach, FL. Their website needed a fresh look that allowed them to showcase their members, and easily add and update content.

I translated the design into a responsive website and created an editing experience that would work for the client. In addition to the site redesign, I also handled data migration from their old site.

Another requirement for this project was to allow chamber members to edit their business pages and submit deals and events. I imported this data for over 400 chamber members, and created an account for each member. I set up [front end forms with Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/create-a-front-end-form/) so members could edit their content.

One of my favorite parts of this project was designing and implementing several CSS animations such as this one on the homepage.
