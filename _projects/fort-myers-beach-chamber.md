excerpt: Custom WordPress build for a chamber of commerce.

This was a custom WordPress site built for Fort Myers Beach Chamber of Commerce, located in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. They needed a website with a fresh look that allowed them to easily add and update content.

As the sole developer on this project, I translated the design into a responsive website and created an editing experience that would work for both the client and members logging in to edit their individual pages. In addition to the site redesign I also handled data migration from their old site. This included importing data and creating accounts for over 400 members.
