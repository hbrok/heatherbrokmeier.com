This was a responsive, custom WordPress site built for Fort Myers Beach Chamber of Commerce, located in Fort Myers Beach, Florida.

In addition to a complete site redesign, all of the data from their previous site needed to be migrated WordPress. This ended up being ~400 member pages which each needed their own account. These member accounts needed the ability to edit and update their own member listing page as well as add and edit events, deals, and blog posts. This was implemented using ACF front end editing, so the chamber members wouldn't need access to the WordPress dashboard.

Project developed for Vector & Ink.
