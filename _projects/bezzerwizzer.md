I designed and developed this project based on the board game [Bezzerwizzer](https://bezzerwizzer.dk/bezzerwizzer-original-uk/#out-of-box).

I wanted to make a online version of the game that would make it easier to play with friends via video chat. You can keep track of player movement, tiles, and scores without needing to own a copy of the game.

I used this project as an opportunity to practice using CSS Grid and ES6 with no frameworks.
