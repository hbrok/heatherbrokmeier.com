This project is based on the board game [Bezzerwizzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezzerwizzer), that I play with friends over Skype. However, they don't own a copy of the game and I wanted to make it easier for us to play this game long distance.

My goal was to make it easy for my friends to keep track of game stats without having to write everything down. This way I can set up my physical copy of the game, and they can use the online version and everyone will know what's going on.

I used this project as an opportunity to practice using ES6 with no frameworks and CSS Grid.
