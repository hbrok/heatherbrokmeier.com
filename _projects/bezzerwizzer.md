excerpt: Bezzerwizzer board game prototype.

I designed and developed this project based on the board game [Bezzerwizzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezzerwizzer).

The goal was to make a version of the game that would help play this game with friends via video chat. The app lets you keep track of all player's movement, tiles, and scores without needing to own a copy of the game.

I used this project as an opportunity to practice using ES6 with no frameworks and CSS Grid.
