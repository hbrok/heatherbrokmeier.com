Grateful Shed is an indoor food truck restaurant based in Wisconsin Dells, WI.

I translated the design into a responsive website that matched Grateful Shed's personality, and crafted an editing experience that made it easy for the client to update.

This site was built with WordPress, using a custom in-house starter theme I created.
