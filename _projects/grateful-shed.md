Grateful Shed is an indoor food truck restaurant based in Wisconsin Dells, WI.

As the sole developer on this project, my role was to take the design and translate it into a responsive website that matched Grateful Shed's personality, and to craft an editing experience that would be easy for the client to update.

This site was built with WordPress website using a custom, in-house starter theme I created as a base.

***Tools used include Webpack, Gulp, and SASS for the front-end build.***
