Woodside Sports Complex is located in Wisconsin Dells, WI. They needed to list all of their sporting events in a way that was both easy to read and easy to update.

This was a custom WordPress build based on a custom in-house starter theme I created. I also built custom blocks in JavaScript for the [WordPress Block Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/).
