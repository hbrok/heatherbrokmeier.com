Woodside Sports Complex is a sports complex located in Wisconsin. They needed a new website that was easy for them to update, and that listed the sports events taking place in an easy to read way.

This was a custom WordPress build based on a custom in-house starter theme built by me. This site also included custom blocks using the [WordPress Block Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/)/
