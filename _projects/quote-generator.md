excerpt: Vanilla JavaScript project created for 10K Apart Challenge.
order: 40
---

This project was created for the [10K Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com/), where the goal was to make a website under 10 kilobytes. To do this, I set a personal goal to stick to vanilla JavaScript.

I made a quote generator that fetches a random quote, font, and color scheme and provides a way to save the combination for sharing. I connected to [Google Fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/) and [Forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/) (for quotes), and I used [davidgorges/color-contrast](https://packagist.org/packages/davidgorges/color-contrast) and [mistic100/randomcolor](https://github.com/mistic100/RandomColor.php) to get accessible color combinations.

I wanted to get started quickly so I started with the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and chose to use PHP and Mustache due to my familiarity with them.
