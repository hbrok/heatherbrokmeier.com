This project was created for the [10K Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com/), where the goal was to make a website under 10 kilobytes. My goal for this project was to get used to using vanilla JavaScript, which I thought was necessary to make it under the 10K goal.

I decided to make a quote generator that would fetch a random quote, font, and color scheme and provide a way to save that combination for sharing. I connected to Google Fonts, [Forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/) for the quotes, and [RandomA11y](http://www.randoma11y.com/) for an accessible color combination.

As someone who cares about performance, I liked the challenge of making such a lightweight site. I also enjoyed being able to connect to so many APIs and make them work together. I also pushed myself to use vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks. It helped me learn a lot and caused me to take that approach in more recent projects.

I knew I wanted to use an easy templating language so I could get started quickly, so I decided on PHP and Mustache due to my familiarity with them.
