Vector & Ink is a marketing agency with locations in Wisconsin Dells, WI and Fort Myers Beach, FL. They needed a new website to showcase their new brand and projects.

My role as the developer on this project was to translate the design into a responsive, interactive website. I took the static design and added interactive elements, like the animated Vector & Ink logo over the hero video:

<video width="320" height="248" loop playsinline autoplay muted poster="/assets/video/vectorink-logo.jpg">
  <source src="/assets/video/vectorink-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

...and lights that drop in when you scroll down the page.

<video width="526" height="216" loop playsinline autoplay muted poster="/assets/video/vectorink-lights.jpg">
  <source src="/assets/video/vectorink-lights.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

This was a custom WordPress build.
