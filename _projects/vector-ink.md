Vector & Ink needed a new website to showcase their brand and projects.

My role as the developer on this project was to translate the design into a responsive, interactive website. I took the static design and added interactive elements, like the animated Vector & Ink logo over the video, and the lights that drop in when you scroll down the page.

This was a custom WordPress build.
