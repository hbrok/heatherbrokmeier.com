I really like podcasts, so I was interested in building a podcast player while learning the ropes of Vue.js. This app pulls from the [Itunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH3-SW1) for searching podcasts, and then pulls all of a podcast's individual episodes from their feed.

It also has a built in player that allows you to play episodes on the page. I adapted some of the audio player functions from Day 11 of Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://www.javascript30.com/) course.
