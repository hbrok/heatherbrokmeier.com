I built this podcast player for fun while learning the ropes of Vue.js. [It started in a Codepen](https://codepen.io/hbrok/pen/NyNReB) and eventually moved to its own project.

It pulls data from the [iTunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH3-SW1) to search for a podcast and list all of its individual episodes.

It includes an audio player that plays episodes in the browser. I adapted some of the audio player functions from Day 11 of Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://www.javascript30.com/) course.
