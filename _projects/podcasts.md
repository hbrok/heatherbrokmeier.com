I built this podcast player for fun while learning the ropes of Vue.js. It started [in a Codepen](https://codepen.io/hbrok/pen/NyNReB) and eventually moved to it's own project.

It pulls data from the [Itunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH3-SW1) to search for podcasts and pull all of a podcast's individual episodes.

The app includes has an audio player that allows you to listen episodes on the page. I adapted some of the audio player functions from Day 11 of Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://www.javascript30.com/) course.
