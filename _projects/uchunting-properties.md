excerpt: Custom WordPress build for a real estate website.
order: 2017
---

UC Hunting Properties is a realty company located in Portage, WI. Their previous site used a pre-built WordPress real estate theme that didn't suit their needs. They needed a custom site that was tailored specifically for them.

I started on this project after most of the front end development work was completed. My focus was to make editing property details as easy and straight-forward as possible.

One major issue I addressed was to add consistency when location data (city, state, county) was added to a property. On the previous site, editors were able to create location names at will which resulted in typos, duplicated location names, and some properties without location data.

I added required latitude and longitude fields and connected to the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) to automatically fetch the location data. Now, when editors add new properties the location data is always present and consistent.
