Wilderness Hotel & Golf Resort is located in Wisconsin Dells, WI. They wanted to combine three separate websites into one easy-to-update site with an updated look.

I converted the design into a responsive WordPress website, created all templates, and migrated all data from a WordPress Multisite into a single website.

One of my favorite parts of this project was working on the <a href="https://www.wildernessresort.com/waterpark-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">waterpark calendar</a>. Previously, an outdated events calendar plugin was used to display waterpark hours, but adding hours for six different waterparks with varying hours was time consuming and difficult to read on the front end. I helped the client avoid this pain by creating a user-friendly admin interface with JavaScript and AJAX that allows them to quickly and easily update hours.
