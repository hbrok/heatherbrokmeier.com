Wilderness Resort was a website redesign for the waterpark resort in the Wisconsin Dells. It was built in WordPress using [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/). 

I was responsible for all development for this site: converting the design into a responsive WordPress website, creating all of the WordPress templates, and migrating data from the previous site into the new site.

One of my favorite parts of this project was working on the waterpark hours calendar. Previously, the website used a traditional events calendar plugin to display the waterpark hours, but adding hours for six different waterparks with varying hours was time consuming and didn't display the hours well. I helped them avoid this pain by creating an easy to use admin interface with JavaScript and AJAX that allows them to click and drag on the calendar to update the hours. It's much easier and quicker to add hours this way and I was glad to be able to provide a user-friendly solution for it.

Project developed for Vector & Ink.
