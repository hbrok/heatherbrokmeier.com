Wilderness Resort was a website redesign for the waterpark resort in the Wisconsin Dells. It was built in WordPress using [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/). 

I was responsible for all development for this site: converting the design into a responsive WordPress website, creating all of the WordPress templates, and migrating data from the previous site into the new site.

One of my favorite parts of this project was working on the waterpark hours calendar. Previously, the website used a traditional events calendar plugin to display the waterpark hours, but adding hours for six different waterparks with varying hours was time consuming and didn't display the hours well.

I helped them avoid this pain by creating an easier to use admin interface on the front end with JavaScript and AJAX. The admin view shows 12 months at a time, and lets an admin click and drag on each month to add hours. It's much easier to add hours this way, and I was glad to be able to provide a user-friendly solution for them.

Project developed for Vector & Ink.
